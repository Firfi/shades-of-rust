example is https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/tree/main/examples/core/rx_state/src

perseus export --release

base[href] has to be set, otherwise it's not runnable;

base[href] has to be set, therefore the build isn't portable

base[href] has to be set, but it doesn't fix the issue and doesn't make the example runnable [on subdirectory] anyways

dist comes from /exported, then also follow symlinks
